## RufasSlider Introduction

RufaSlider is a collection of 16 different block slider puzzles for kids and casual puzzlers that works on laptops and PCs running Windows or most Linux distros.

It includes a Klotski-style family, a DirtyDozen family, and a Traffic-Rush family.  And now these puzzle families come with AutoSolvers to help you.

The Klotski family uses rectangles of 4 sizes: 1x1, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1. The objective in each game is stated near the window top, but usually involves moving a large block to a specified location within the window.  

The DirtyDozen family is similar except there are L-shaped puzzle pieces.

The Traffic-Rush family uses cars or trucks that can only move [roll] lengthwise...the goal being to move the red car toward the shaded "exit door".

The game description files are simple text files that allow users to define additional puzzles.

Several other classic block slider games are included:  Fifteen, Eight, Nine, Panama, MaBoy, GetMyGoat, 2-versions of HoleInOne, Suits, and 2-versions of LinkRings. 

* Also included are two of my own creations: Flat7, FlatAZ. These are 2-dimensional versions of my 3D "Rufas Cubes", available at:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/rufascube/

* Many of these puzzles are also available as retro ASCII puzzles that run in a command-line terminal on Windows, OS-X and Gnu/Linux; and is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/coterminalapps/

* These are all 2D slider puzzles. I created four 3D slider puzzles that also run on Windows, OS-X, and Linux, using OpenGL graphics. It is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/reliquarium/

To move a block, use the arrow keys. If the automatic block selector chooses the wrong block, simply click the cursor on the desired block before using the arrow key. Thusly, the games are laptop friendly.

Rush & maboy allow mouse drags to initiate the moves.

Finally, there are autosolvers embedded into the TrafficRush, Klotski, DirtyDozen, LinkRings, Maboy Flat7, FlatAZ and Annoy games to be used interactively, using the (=)-key.  This provides an amazing tool to learn to solve seemingly hopeless problems.

### AutoSolvers Note

The slowest of the bunch is in FlatAZ, which can take up to 10 seconds to solve a level 5 shuffle. When it is done, it will countdown the remaining steps toward a solution as you continue to press the "="-key


--------------------------------------
## Features

* Works on PCs or laptops running Windows or GNU/Linux.  And if GNAT is installed you can build it yourself!  But first try the delivered, prebuilt binaries.
* Windows & GNU/Linux binaries provided, as well as full source.
* Laptop friendly controls; can support Mac Retina displays.
* Uses SDL2;
* Uses OpenAL-audio for sound.
* all runtime files are in ./data/
* all game data files are in ./puzzles/

* no installation
* no dependencies
* simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
* or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.

----------------------------------------------


## Setup and Running:

Windows users see also "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.
Open a command line terminal, then cd to the install directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type "winslid.bat" to begin puzzling.
You may also cd ./bin/w64/, and then type any individual puzzle name, eg: rush.exe.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users should type "gnuslid.sh" to access any game.
You may also ce ./bin/gnu/, and then type any individual puzzle name, eg: rush.

Also, if you have wine installed on your linux system, you can run the windows EXE thusly:

	* cd bin/w64/
	* wine rufaslid.exe

----------------------------------------------------------------
### Advice
Most of these apps use SDL2, which is pretty extravagent with system memory.
The selection program "rufaslid" uses lots of system memory.
You can economize by simply running your favorite puzzle directly 
from the command line, thusly:
EG1 (linux) : cd bin/gnu; rush
EG2 (Windows) : cd bin\w64; rush.exe
EG3 (wine) : cd bin/w64; wine rush.exe

----------------------------------------------------------------

In many puzzles, a mouse drag can initiate a block move.  However, the preferred method to move a block is to select it using a mouse click, then use the arrow keys  (up),(dn),(lf),(rt).  The block selection is not necessary when only one block can move in the indicated direction. EG FourSuits, eight & fifteen never require block selection since there is only 1 empty space.

At any time, hit the letter (r) to reset/restart, or (esc) to quit.  

For Rush, Bslider, Annoying and DirtyDozen, you use the (n) key to go to the next puzzle, which in general is more difficult.  The (p) key takes you to the previous puzzle.

Note that I created about 20% of the Rush puzzles (filenames that end "my.rush"), including the most difficult one "zzzz_89my.rush".


And for those times when a solution seems impossible, the more difficult puzzle families have an AutoSolver function using the (=)-key to step closer towards the solution:  rush, bslider, dirty12, maboy, annoy, and linkRings.  Remember that you can stop using the autosolver at any time and try to manually solve the puzzle from a configuration that is a few steps closer to a solution.

Note that there are two "external" solvers available:  1) fbfsr for traffic rush puzzles (writes to rpath.txt);  2) fbfsl (writes to lpath.txt) for a) MaBoy; b) dirtyDozen; c) bslider puzzles.  Simply type the executable name followed by the puzzle file name.  For example to solve the second DirtyDozen puzzle type "fbfsl ../../puzzles/dd02.blk".  The solution is written to a file in the current directory, in this case, named lpath.txt.  Then, to follow the output instructions, start the puzzle and reveal the letters by hitting the (a)-key.

----------------------------------------------

## Build Requirements:

 * a recent GNU g++/Ada compiler that supports -std=c++11.
 * graphics card that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;

-------------------------------------------------------

## Build Instructions:

Begin by installing GNU g++.

-------------------------------------------------------
**Windows64** => w64all.bat

Windows developers, please also read "gnuOnWindows.txt".

------------------------------------------------------
**GNU/Linux** => gnuAll.sh:

utilizes shared libraries that are delivered in this bundle under ./libs/gnu/.  These were used to build the executable, which should run in the presence of ./libs/gnu/, whether or not your system already has those libraries.  The runtime loader will prefer system libraries if they are present.

If the delivered linux binary does not run, rebuild all using gnuAll.sh.  In case of problems.



-------------------------------------------------------

## what is special about this project?
Uses the C++ programming language and fully modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Achieves [at least] version 3.3 core profile contexts.  Compiles and runs on Windows & GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability and open source freedom, this project relies on SDL2, a PNG-loader by Lode Vandevenne, and OpenAL-Audio.

## future plans
Elliminate SDL2 in favor of GLFW.
