Where is the source code?

This repository exists for the convenience of gamers, not co-developers.  
The tarball contains all the source code, as well as the runtime files 
for 3 platforms, headers, shaders, textures, music, game files, 
compilation scripts, nonstandard external libraries, and executables, 
including a Mac-bundle.  Source code [*.cpp, *.hpp, *.cc, *.h] can 
be found in the root directory.
