------------------------------------------------------------------
## RufasSlider Introduction

RufaSlider is a collection of 16 different block slider puzzles for kids and casual puzzlers that works on laptops and PCs running Windows, OSX or most Linux distros.

It includes a Klotski-style family, a DirtyDozen family, and a Traffic-Rush family.  And now these puzzle families come with AutoSolvers to help you.

The Klotski family uses rectangles of 4 sizes: 1x1, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1. The objective in each game is stated near the window top, but usually involves moving a large block to a specified location within the window.  

The DirtyDozen family is similar except there are L-shaped puzzle pieces.

The Traffic-Rush family uses cars or trucks that can only move [roll] lengthwise...the goal being to move the red car toward the shaded "exit door".

Note that a game description files are simple text files that allows users to define additional puzzles.

Several other classic block slider games are included:  Fifteen, Eight, Nine, Panama, MaBoy, GetMyGoat, 2-versions of HoleInOne, Suits, and 2-versions of LinkRings.  

To move a block, use the arrow keys. If the automatic block selector chooses the wrong block, simply click the cursor on the desired block before using the arrow key. Thusly, the games are laptop friendly.

Rush & maboy allow mouse drags to initiate the moves.

Finally, there are autosolvers embedded into the TrafficRush, Klotski, DirtyDozen, LinkRings and Maboy games to be used interactively, using the (=)-key.  This provides an amazing tool to learn to solve seemingly hopeless problems.

--------------------------------------
## Features

* Works on PCs or laptops running Windows, OSX(>=10.13) or GNU/Linux.  And if GNAT is installed you can build it yourself!  But first try the delivered, prebuilt binaries.
* Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX binaries provided, as well as full source.
* Laptop friendly controls; can support Mac Retina displays.
* Uses SDL2;
* Uses OpenAL-audio for sound.
* all runtime files are in ./data/
* all game data files are in ./puzzles/

* no installation
* no dependencies
* simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
* or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.

----------------------------------------------


## Setup and Running:

Windows users see also "windows-setup.txt".
Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.
Open a command line terminal, then cd to the install directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type "winslid.bat" to begin puzzling.
You may also cd ./bin/w64/, and then type any individual puzzle name, eg: rush.exe.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users should type "gnuslid.sh" to access any game.
You may also ce ./bin/gnu/, and then type any individual puzzle name, eg: rush.

Also, if you have wine installed on your linux system, you can run the windows EXE thusly:

	* cd bin/w64/
	* wine rufaslid.exe


----------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users may open a terminal, navigate to the install directory, and type "macslid.sh" on the command line.  Alternatively, Mac users may initiate the game in the usual way by navigating to the installation directory in Finder and clicking the "rufaslider.app" icon named "rufaslider".

In many puzzles, a mouse drag can initiate a block move.  However, the preferred method to move a block is to select it using a mouse click, then use the arrow keys  (up),(dn),(lf),(rt).  The block selection is not necessary when only one block can move in the indicated direction.

At any time, hit the letter (r) to reset/restart, or (esc) to quit.  

For Rush, Bslider and DirtyDozen, you use the (n) key to go to the next puzzle, which in general is more difficult.  The (p) key takes you to the previous puzzle.

And for those times when a solution seems impossible, the more difficult puzzle families have an AutoSolver function using the (=)-key to step closer towards the solution:  rush, bslider, dirty12, maboy, and linkRings.  Remember that you can stop using the autosolver at any time and try to manually solve the puzzle.

Note that there are two "external" solvers available:  1) fbfsr for traffic rush puzzles (writes to rpath.txt);  2) fbfsl (writes to lpath.txt) for a) MaBoy; b) dirtyDozen; c) bslider puzzles.  Simply type the executable name followed by the puzzle file name.  For example to solve the second DirtyDozen puzzle type "fbfsl ../../puzzles/dd02.blk".  The solution is written to a file in the current directory, in this case, named lpath.txt.  Then, to follow the output instructions, start the puzzle and reveal the letters by hitting the (a)-key.

----------------------------------------------

## Build Requirements:

 * a recent GNU g++ compiler that supports -std=c++11.
 * graphics card that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;

-------------------------------------------------------

## Build Instructions:

Begin by installing GNU g++.

-------------------------------------------------------
**Windows64** => w64all.bat

Windows developers, please also read "gnuOnWindows.txt".

-------------------------------------------------------

**MacOSX** => osxAll.sh:

script for OSX that references [delivered] local copies of all nonstandard libraries in ./libs/osx/.  The intent is to allow anyone to build without having to install these nonstandard libraries.

------------------------------------------------------
**GNU/Linux** => gnuAll.sh:

utilizes shared libraries that are delivered in this bundle under ./libs/gnu/.  These were used to build the executable, which should run in the presence of ./libs/gnu/, whether or not your system already has those libraries.  The runtime loader will prefer system libraries if they are present.

If the delivered linux binary does not run, rebuild all using gnuAll.sh.  In case of problems.


### Fixable Link Problems during linux build:

On a linux build machine, you might have minor link errors, depending on its configuration.  If "libGL" cannot be found, this literally means "libGL.so" was absent.  But you might have "libGL.so.1" present.  In this case, simply create a softlink by changing to the libGL directory, then type the line:

sudo ln -s libGL.so.1 libGL.so  (and enter the admin password)

whence the linker should now be able to find what it wants.  But if there is more than one file libGL.so present on your system, make sure you use the best one;  i.e. the one that corresponds to your accelerated graphics.




-------------------------------------------------------

## what is special about this project?
Uses the C++ programming language and fully modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Achieves [at least] version 3.3 core profile contexts.  Compiles and runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OSX systems.

Focusing on portability and open source freedom, this project relies on SDL2, a PNG-loader by Lode Vandevenne, and OpenAL-Audio.

## Media Files for RufasSlider:

### General Note
The particular choice of sound file delivered is not essential to the function of the game and is easily replaced.  This software is primarily intended as a tutorial example of modern OpenGL methods.  The only requirements are that sounds be in WAV format.

It is my intention to use media with copyrights or licenses that are compatible with GPLv3. Please notify me if you believe there is an incompatibility, and it will be removed ASAP, eg a CC-by-NC license is NOT GPL compatible.



### SoundFiles
